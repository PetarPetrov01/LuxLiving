# Lux Living
The aim of this project is to create a sophisticated and user-friendly full-stack web application for high-end real estate properties. The frontend, crafted with ReactJS, and styled with styled components, offers a visually engaging and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless experience for users as they explore premium property listings.
The back-end is built with the Express,js and all the important information about the users and the properties are stored with MongoDB.
