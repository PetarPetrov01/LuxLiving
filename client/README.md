# LuxLiving

## Getting started
Navigate to the project directory. Once you are inside the project directory, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

After the installation is complete, you can start the client using:
```bash
npm start
```
Note that the server should also be started for the application to work. To become familiar with the server, you can read its documentation [here](https://github.com/PetarPetrov01/LuxLiving/tree/main/server#readme).
