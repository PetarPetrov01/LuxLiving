This document provides details about the REST API endpoints exposed by the Property Service. The service allows users to create their own profile,manage properties, place bids, and retrieve property information.

### Error Responses

If there is an error processing a request, the API will respond with an appropriate HTTP status code and a JSON object containing an error message.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid request, missing required parameter."
}
```
## Authentication

To access some of the endpoints (e.g. creating and managing posts, placing a bid), authentication is required. Users need to include a valid JWT token in the authorization header of their HTTP requests.

```
Request Headers:
"Authorization": {accessToken}
```

All authentication-related endpoints are under the `/users` namespace.

### Register

To create a new user send a `POST` request to `/users/register` with email and password. Upon successfull request, the service creates a session and returns an authorized token (accessToken).

#### Example regsiter request
```
POST /users/register
Content-Type: application/json
```
Request body:
```js
{
  email: "example_email",
  password: "example_pass"
}
```
#### Example regsiter response
```js
{
    _id: {id generated by the service},
    email: "example_email",
    accessToken: {generatedAccessToken}
}
```
### Login
To log in as an already created user send `POST` request to `/users/login`. The service authenticates the user and returns an object with accessToken for subsequent requests.
#### Example login request
```
POST /users/login
Content-Type: application/json
```
Request body:
```js
{
  email: "example_email",
  password: "example_pass"
}
```
#### Example login response
The service responds with the object similar to what is found in the [registration](#example-request) process.

### Logout
To logout the current user, send an authorized `GET` request to `/users/logout`. The service blakclists the token and responds with 204 - No Content.

### Property service
The base url for accessing the properties is `/data/catalog`
